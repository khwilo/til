# Generating resources using scaffold  

A **resource** is a combination of a data model together with a web interface to that model. For example a user data model can also contain its user web interface thus constituting a Users resource. This allows us to think of users as	 objects that can be created, read, updated and deleted via the HTTP protocol.  

Rails scaffolding is generated by passing the **scaffold** command to the `rails generate script`. The argument of the **scaffold** command is the singular version of the resource name together with optional parameters for the data model attributes.  
Example command:  
```bash
$ rails generate scaffold User name:string email:string
```  

There is no need for including a parameter **id** since it is created automatically by Rails for use as the *primary key* in the database.  

To update the database with the new **users** data model, *migrate* the database using *Rake*.  
```bash
$ bundle exec rake db:migrate
```  

The `bundle exec` command ensures that the command uses the version of Rake corresponding to the Gemfile.  

### NOTE
Rake is a *Ruby make*, a make like language written in Ruby. Rails uses Rake extensively, especially for the innumerable little administrative tasks necessary when developing database-backed web applications.  
You can list of database tasks using `-T db`:  
```bash
$ bundle exec rake -T db
```  

To see all the Rake tasks available, run  
```bash
$ bundle exec rake -T
```
